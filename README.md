# 🎯 Connect Four AI (Python)

## About  
🎮 A Python console-based **Connect Four** game where you face off against an **unbeatable AI** powered by the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning**.  
The AI uses heuristics such as center-column preference and pattern scoring to make optimal moves.  
Difficulty can be adjusted by changing the search depth, allowing for quick casual games or intense strategic battles — all in your terminal, no extra libraries needed.

## ✨ Features  
- 🧠 **Unbeatable AI** with Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning  
- 🎯 **Adjustable difficulty** (depth 3–6)  
- 🏆 Smart heuristics: center bias + blocking + win detection  
- 📜 Pure Python — no external dependencies  
- 🖥️ Console-based 7×6 Connect Four board
